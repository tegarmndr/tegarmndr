# Hi, I'm Tegar ðŸ‘‹

A **Junior Software Engineer** from Indonesia, focused on designing and building scalable, maintainable, and user-centered systems. I work mainly with **React (TypeScript)** and **Laravel**, supported by **MariaDB** and **Oracle** for database management. My goal is to create reliable digital solutions that balance clear architecture with a seamless user experience. I approach software development as a continuous learning process. Every project helps me strengthen my understanding of system design, data flow, and application architecture. My goal is to build software that remains stable, adaptable, and easy to maintain as it grows. For me, good architecture isnâ€™t just about performance, but about how well it supports long-term maintainability and aligns with real user and business needs.
